# LICO Tool Installation Guide

An improved concolic-testing tool for Java projects, with enhanced loop-related error detection.


## Introduction

This README provides instructions for installing and running the LICO tool.


## System Requirements

Before running the tool, ensure that the following software components are installed and properly configured:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 11 or higher)
- **Apache Maven**
- **Z3 SMT Solver with Java bindings**
- **Postman** (for invoking and testing RESTful APIs)

⚠️ All required tools must be correctly configured in the system environment
(e.g., JAVA_HOME, MAVEN_HOME, and native library paths for Z3).


## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the tool source code:

    git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project root directory:

    cd <project-directory>


## Step 2: Install and Configure Required Dependencies

### CIA Tool
Replace the `mrmathami` folder in `Users/admin/.m2/repository` with the version
downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1c_FdlggwXR_xfr1hdL4L-zvnwr5ND5hA[link].

### Java Development Kit (JDK)

Install a supported JDK version and verify the installation:

    java -version

### Apache Maven

Install Apache Maven and verify the installation:

    mvn -version


### Z3 SMT Solver (Java Bindings)

1. Install the Z3 SMT Solver with Java bindings.
2. Ensure that the Z3 native library is accessible at runtime
3. Verify the installation:

    z3 --version


### Postman

Install Postman to send HTTP requests and interact with the tool’s RESTful APIs.


## Step 3: Build the Project with Maven

This step builds all service modules by cleaning existing artifacts and installing
their dependencies using Maven.

Navigate to each service directory that contains a `pom.xml` file and execute:

    mvn clean install


## Step 4: Run Spring Boot Services

Navigate to each of the following service modules:

    - `api-gateway`
    - `discovery-server`
    - `unitTesting`
    - `upload-project-service`

For each module, start the Spring Boot application using one of the supported methods.

### Using Maven:
    mvn spring-boot:run

### Using an IDE:
Alternatively, launch the application by running the main class annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` from an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).

⚠️ Ensure that all listed services are started successfully and are properly registered and connected before proceeding to the next step.


## Step 5: Invoke the Tool via RESTful APIs

The tool is designed to be accessed programmatically through RESTful APIs.

### API Testing Using Postman

1. Launch Postman.
2. Select the appropriate API endpoint.
3. Upload the ZIP file containing the Java project to be tested.
4. Choose the method and coverage level you want to run:
    - Tag ID
    - Desired coverage level: `statement`, `branch`, `mcmd`
5. Send the request to initiate the testing process.

## Service Port Configuration

The system is composed of multiple Spring Boot–based microservices, each running on a dedicated network port to support service isolation and inter-service communication.

The default port configuration is defined as follows:

- `api-gateway`: 8005
- `discovery-server`: 8761
- `unitTesting`: 8006
- `upload-project-service`: 8020
